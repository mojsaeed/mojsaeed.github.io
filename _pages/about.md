I was an [Apple](https://apple.com/) AIML Resident working on LLMs and morphologically complex languages. My work tackled how LLMs perform on morphologically rich languages.

Prior to that, I spent one year as an Applied Researcher at AMEX GBT.

I did my PhD at [EURECOM](https://www.eurecom.fr/en), under the supervision of [Prof. Paolo Papotti](https://www.eurecom.fr/~papotti/).

In my free time, I aim to spend time away from my computer. You can find me playing squash, doing drum covers of songs I like, or discovering something new in ~~Paris~~ **[TBD]**.
