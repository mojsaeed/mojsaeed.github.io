abstract = {In many use-cases, information is stored in text but not available in structured data. However, extracting data from natural language (NL) text to precisely fit a schema, and thus enable querying, is a challenging task. With the rise of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs), there is now an effective solution to store and use information extracted from massive corpora of text documents. Thus, we envision the use of SQL queries to cover a broad range of data that is not captured by traditional databases (DBs) by tapping the information in LLMs. This ability enables querying the factual information in LLMs with the SQL interface, which is more precise than NL prompts. We present a traditional DB architecture using physical operators for querying the underlying LLM. The key idea is to execute some operators of the query plan with prompts that retrieve data from the LLM. For a large class of SQL queries, querying LLMs returns well structured relations, with encouraging qualitative results.},

    abstract = {One reason for the positive impact of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) in NLP tasks is their ability to encode semantic types, such as `European City' or `Woman'. While previous work has analyzed such information in the context of interpretability, it is not clear how to use types to steer the PLM output. For example, in a cloze statement, it is desirable to steer the model to generate a token that satisfies a user-specified type, e.g., predict a "date" rather than a "location". In this work, we introduce Type Embeddings (TEs), an input embedding that promotes desired types in a PLM. Our proposal is to define a type by a small set of word examples. We empirically study the ability of TEs both in representing types and in steering masking predictions without changes to the prompt text in BERT. Finally, using the LAMA datasets, we show how TEs highly improve the precision in extracting facts from PLMs.},

However, traditional fact-checking is a process requiring scarce expert human resources, and thus does not scale well on social media because of the continuous flow of new content to be checked.

In this work, we study the first large-scale effort of crowdsourced fact-checking deployed in practice, started by Twitter with the Birdwatch program. Our analysis shows that crowdsourcing may be an effective fact-checking strategy in some settings, even comparable to results obtained by human experts, but does not lead to consistent, actionable results in others. We processed 11.9k tweets verified by the Birdwatch program and report empirical evidence of i) differences in how the crowd and experts select content to be fact-checked, ii) how the crowd and the experts retrieve different resources to fact-check, and iii) the edge the crowd shows in fact-checking scalability and efficiency as compared to expert checkers."

abstract = {Applications such as computational fact checking and data-to-text generation exploit the relationship between relational data and natural language text. Despite promising results in these areas, state of the art solutions simply fail in managing "data-ambiguity", i.e., the case when there are multiple interpretations of the relationship between the textual sentence and the relational data. To tackle this problem, we introduce Pythia, a system that, given a relational table D, generates textual sentences that contain factual ambiguities w.r.t. the data in D. Such sentences can then be used to train target applications in handling data-ambiguity. In this demonstration, we first show how our system generates data ambiguous sentences for a given table in an unsupervised fashion by data profiling and query generation. We then demonstrate how two existing applications benefit from Pythia's generated sentences, improving the state-of-the-art results. The audience will interact with Pythia by changing input parameters in an interactive fashion, including the upload of their own dataset to see what data ambiguous sentences are generated for it.},

    abstract = {While pre-trained language models (PLMs) are the go-to solution to tackle many natural language processing problems, they are still very limited in their ability to capture and to use common-sense knowledge. In fact, even if information is available in the form of approximate (soft) logical rules, it is not clear how to transfer it to a PLM in order to improve its performance for deductive reasoning tasks. Here, we aim to bridge this gap by teaching PLMs how to reason with soft Horn rules. We introduce a classification task where, given facts and soft rules, the PLM should return a prediction with a probability for a given hypothesis. We release the first dataset for this task, and we propose a revised loss function that enables the PLM to learn how to predict precise probabilities for the task. Our evaluation results show that the resulting fine-tuned models achieve very high performance, even on logical rules that were unseen at training. Moreover, we demonstrate that logical notions expressed by the rules are transferred to the fine-tuned model, yielding state-of-the-art results on external datasets.},

Scrutinizer coordinates teams of human fact checkers. It reduces verification time by proposing queries or query fragments to the users. Those proposals are based on claim text classifiers, that gradually improve during the verification of a large document. In addition, Scrutinizer uses tentative execution of query candidates to narrow down the set of alternatives. The verification process is controlled by a cost-based optimizer. It optimizes the interaction with users and prioritizes claim verifications. For the latter, it considers expected verification overheads as well as the expected claim utility as training samples for the classifiers. We evaluate the Scrutinizer system using simulations and a user study with professional fact checkers, based on actual claims and data. Our experiments consistently demonstrate significant savings in verification time, without reducing result accuracy.},

We present a fact checking method that uses reference information in knowledge graphs (KGs) to assess claims and explain its decisions. KGs contain a formal representation of knowledge with semantic descriptions of entities and their relationships. We exploit such rich semantics to produce interpretable explanations for the fact checking output. As information in a KG is inevitably incomplete, we rely on logical rule discovery and on Web text mining to gather the evidence to assess a given claim. Uncertain rules and facts are turned into logical programs and the checking task is modeled as an inference problem in a probabilistic extension of answer set programs. Experiments show that the probabilistic inference enables the efficient labeling of claims with interpretable explanations, and the quality of the results is higher than state of the art baselines.},

  abstract={The surge of misinformation poses a serious problem for fact-checkers. Several initiatives for manual fact-checking have stepped up to combat this ordeal. However, computational methods are needed to make the verification faster and keep up with the increasing abundance of false information. Machine Learning (ML) approaches have been proposed as a tool to ease the work of manual fact-checking. Specifically, the act of checking textual claims by using relational datasets has recently gained a lot of traction. However, despite the abundance of proposed solutions, there has not been any formal definition of the problem, nor a comparison across the different assumptions and results. In this work, we make a first attempt at solving these ambiguities. First, we formalize the problem by providing a general definition that is applicable to all systems and that is agnostic to their assumptions. Second, we define general dimensions to characterize different prominent systems in terms of assumptions and features. Finally, we report experimental results over three scenarios with corpora of real-world textual claims.},
